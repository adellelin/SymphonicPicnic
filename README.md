### playful experiments with interactive audio installations

We aim to create soundscapes and interactive spaces.

We design wireless interactive audio devices to syncphonize sound and allow people to play together over great distances (1000s of feet) with minmal latency.

We have showcased at:

0. Time Square Alliance and [NYU Come Out And Play](http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2016/07/26/bright-lights-big-games)
0. PS1 Moma and [Code Liberation](http://codeliberation.org/) NYC
0. V&A Museum and [Code Liberation](http://codeliberation.org/) UK
0. Upcoming : [NYCResistor](http://www.nycresistor.com/) Interactive Showcase

To further the research we also using these to create a remote voice and public interface for a set of connected garments : [video](https://vimeo.com/210477639)

This github repo hosts pcb designs, source codes, and audio samples for the various installations and other experiements along the way.
